# IOS-XE-ZTP

Code for ZTP with IOS XE 16.9


## Business/Technical Challenge

Business Problem - Legacy devices in the customer network are approaching end of life milestones and need to be replaced. However, the customer does not have enough staff resources to deploy the required quantity of new Cisco networking equipment. Additionally, new customer deployments are prone to error due to manual provisioning.

Technical Challenge - Develop a solution which enables the customer to auto-provision devices thus reducing deployment errors and saving staff resource time.

## Proposed Solution

Proposed Solution - Create a Python script with supporting services to auto-provision devices for Day 0 deployment.
